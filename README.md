# **Car Sharing Online**
___
## Introduction

### What is it?
This is the Web application powered by Java Spring Boot.<br />This project  provides the main backend functionality of the **Sharing cars**.
>_The main goal of creating the project was to master the tools of Java in the process of the building all its components from scratch._

## Technologies and Tools used
So,

+ **Java 17** Project is relazed on Java 17 
+ **Spring Boot Web**
+ **Tomcat** - This application is a self-contained HTTP server by using embedded Tomcat
+ **Hibernate** - For work with data and for CRUD operations is used Hibernate
+ **Spring Data JPA**- Hibernate working with specification for managing relational data Java Persistence API (Spring Data JPA)
+ **Lombok** is used for automatic building getters and setters for entities
+ **Paginating** and sorting are maintaining
+ **Liquibase** - All tables are generate by Liquibase when the application is running the first time
+ **MapStruct** - Mapping between different object models (Entities and DTOs) is generated by MapStruct
+ **JpaRepository** - Basic CRUD operations are generated and managed by JpaRepository, custom methods is written with Query with Params usage
+ **MySQL** - relational database is used to store and manage data in application. 
+ **SoftDeleting** approach is applied
+ **Swagger**  - In my Spring Boot application, I use the Swagger UI tool to automatically generate documentation for REST APIs
+ **Spring Boot Security** - Application is defended with usage of Spring Boot Security. Authenticantion and access-control by roles are provided
+ **JSON Web Token** - Authenticantion is processing by getting a login and password in request and generation a JWT (JSON Web Token) in respond. In the next requests bearer tokens enable requests to authenticate using this token as an access key
+ **The SecurityFilterChain** defines the sequence of filters that will be applied to the request
+ **Access by roles** - This application has two users roles : Admin and User
+ **Paying system Stripe** - This application use Stripe for online paying
+ **Telegram Bot** - Sends notifications to the administrator's telegram
+ **Docker** - Application completly is containered by Docker
+ **IntelliJ IDEA** - All work with this project had been doing in IntelliJ IDEA IDE
+ **Maven** - Building and checking code style with Maven
+ **GitHub** - Transfering to GitHub 
+ **AWS** - Launched on AWS service EC2.
